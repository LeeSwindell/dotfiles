Here are my config files. It should be self explanatory where to put them, but
the directories also have info if needed.

Some of the included configs are: Neovim, Hammerspoon keybindings for opening
safari/chrome/terminal/pdf viewer, homebrew installs. 

To add later: installed apps - Anki/Rectangle/Jellyfin/Sync that I haven't
configured beyond default. Good to have a list of things to reinstall.
